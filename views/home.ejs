                alt="sad-man-sitting on a couch with an alcholic drink">People who have a substance use disorder often find that overcoming it is more
                challenging
                than expected. They may feel that addiction is a myth and they can quit any time they want or that they
                are an exception to the rule. This can also occur with behavioral addictions such as eating, sex,
                smoking gambling, shopping, and even activies seemingly mundane or safe such as exercise, or work.
                Learning to
                overcome an addiction is vital for anyone experiencing a substance use disorder, alcohol use disorder,
                or behavioral addiction.Recoverees may
                also find that in trying to overcome one addiction, such as giving pornography for drinking or
                gambling for smoking. They may also add another addiction, such as picking up drinking along with
                gambling or starting to smoke as they suffer from substance abuse. <br>
                However not all hope is lost. There are dozens of websites that can used to gain information on
                addictions and how they can affect both you and your family. There are also support groups for nearly
                every kind of addiction imaginable. Whether they are succesful recoverees, or people in simliart
                situtations, you will be surrouned by people who understand your situtation.
                While challenging, recognizing that
                there is a problem and learning more about the process of quitting are significant first steps in
                recovery.</p>

                <h3>What is Addiction</h3>
                <p>Addiction can be either physical or behavioral, and often they go hand in hand. Though alcohol and
                    tobacco
                    are
                    commonly recognized types of addiction, there are actually hundreds of types of medically and
                    scientifically
                    recognized addictions. Cravings, compulsions, inability to stop, and lifestyle dysfunction all point
                    to
                    the
                    existence of some type of
                    addiction. A person can be addicted to behaviors just as seriously as one can be addicted to
                    substances
                    such
                    as
                    alcohol or hard drugs.The addictive behaviors that result from both types of addiction can have
                    serious
                    negative
                    consequences though,
                    from all that comes with a substance use disorder to the perils of a gambling addiction, or even
                    compulsive
                    shopping and sexual behavior to an unhealthy degree. Addiction is a complex disease. The type of
                    addiction
                    doesn’t really matter as much as the underlying issue
                    causing the patient to chase that pleasurable feeling while incurring adverse
                    consequences.<br>Addiction
                    interferes with normal brain function, particularly in the reward system.When you do something you
                    find enjoyable, whether that’s hanging out with your best friend, drinking a bottle of
                    wine, or using cocaine, this reward system releases the neurotransmitter dopamine along with other
                    chemicals.Contrary to popular belief, dopamine doesn’t appear to actually cause feelings of pleasure
                    or
                    euphoria. Instead,
                    it seems to reinforce your brain’s association between certain things and feelings of pleasure,
                    driving
                    you
                    to
                    seek those things out again in the future.</p>

                <h3>Why Overcoming Addiction Is So Difficult</h3>
                <p>According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, addiction is a "treatable, chronic medical
                    disease
                    involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an inpidual’s
                    life
                    experiences." People continue to engage in harmful behaviors despite negative consequences because
                    addiction
                    changes the brain's reward system, which increases the desire for the substances or experiences.
                    These
                    changes
                    in the brain also affect impulse control and judgment, which makes quitting that much more
                    challenging.
                    Addiction is treatable; with supportive resources and the right treatment approach, you can overcome
                    the
                    physical and mental challenges you face to recover. Overcoming addictions can be difficult,
                    especially
                    when
                    attempting to do it alone. Fortunately, you are not alone you have friends and family you can reach
                    out
                    to.
                    There are support groups for nearly every kind of addiction you may find yourself struggling with.
                    It is

                    you to

        <h3>Some Do's and Do Not's in Recovery</h3>
        <div class="toDos">

            <div class="toDo">
                <ol>
                    <li>Do continue to work your program.</li>
                    <li>Do involve others in your recovery. Continue to talk to someone when
                        needed regarding your emotional & mental health.</li>
                    <li>Do use the activities that work best for you and promote your
                        recovery. This is different for everyone.</li>
                    <li>Do keep busy (do things to help your physical health, participate in
                        service activities, spend time with family or friends)</li>
                    <li>Do take up a wholesome hobby.</li>
                    <li>Identify places that can act as a trigger</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="toNotDo">
                <ol>
                    <li>Do not underestimate your problem. This can happen to those who have
                        clean time under their belt.</li>
                    <li>Do not fall into dangerous behaviors or emotions. (I.e. dishonesty,
                        blame, self-pity, resentment etc.)</li>
                    <li>Do not get complacent with your life and recovery. Boredom is
                        dangerous.</li>
                    <li>Do not frequent places that can act as a trigger</li>
                    <li>Do not replace your addiction with something else.</li>
                    <li>Do not fall into self-pity when you have done something wrong or
                        relapsed.</li>
                </ol>
