            <div class="toDo">
                <ol>
                    <li>Do continue to work your program.</li>
                    <li>Do involve others in your recovery. Continue to talk to someone when
                        needed regarding your emotional & mental health.</li>
                    <li>Do use the activities that work best for you and promote your
                        recovery. This is different for everyone.</li>
                    <li>Do keep busy (do things to help your physical health, participate in
                        service activities, spend time with family or friends)</li>
                    <li>Do take up a wholesome hobby.</li>
                    <li>Identify places that can act as a trigger</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="toNotDo">
                <ol>
                    <li>Do not underestimate your problem. This can happen to those who have
                        clean time under their belt.</li>
                    <li>Do not fall into dangerous behaviors or emotions. (I.e. dishonesty,
                        blame, self-pity, resentment etc.)</li>
                    <li>Do not get complacent with your life and recovery. Boredom is
                        dangerous.</li>
                    <li>Do not frequent places that can act as a trigger</li>
                    <li>Do not replace your addiction with something else.</li>
                    <li>Do not fall into self-pity when you have done something wrong or
                        relapsed.</li>
                </ol>
